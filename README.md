Purple is a Rust library developed to empower the open-source version of [RosaryAV](https://github.com/WHots/RosaryAV). It provides a comprehensive set of file manipulation and quarantining functionalities, specifically tailored to enhance the capabilities of the open-source iteration of the RosaryAV project. This library, codenamed "Purple," is intended to serve as the core system for handling various file-related tasks within the context of RosaryAV.

## Features

- **File Operations:** The Purple library enables developers to perform a variety of file-related tasks, including obtaining detailed information such as file names, extensions, sizes, and concatenating file-specific tags.

- **Quarantine Management:** This library includes a powerful `QuarantineManager` module, designed to simplify and customize file quarantining processes, allowing for efficient management of potentially harmful files.

## Under Active Development

Purple is actively developed to incorporate new features, improvements, and bug fixes. Our team is dedicated to enhancing and maintaining the library to meet the evolving needs of the RosaryAV open-source project.
